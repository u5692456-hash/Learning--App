      title: 'JavaScript Fundamentals',
      content: `# JavaScript Core Concepts

Based on the content from "${fileName}", here are the key JavaScript concepts covered:

## Variables and Data Types

JavaScript supports various data types including:

### Primitive Types
- **String**: Textual data enclosed in quotes
- **Number**: Integer and floating-point numbers
- **Boolean**: true or false values
- **Undefined**: Variable declared but not assigned
- **Null**: Intentional absence of value
- **Symbol**: Unique identifier (ES6)
- **BigInt**: Large integers beyond Number limit

### Reference Types
- **Objects**: Collections of key-value pairs
- **Arrays**: Ordered lists of values
- **Functions**: Reusable blocks of code
- **Date**: Date and time objects
- **RegExp**: Regular expressions for pattern matching

## Variable Declaration

### var (Legacy)
- Function-scoped
- Can be redeclared
- Hoisted to top of function

### let (Modern)
- Block-scoped
- Cannot be redeclared in same scope
- Temporal dead zone before declaration

### const (Modern)
- Block-scoped
- Cannot be reassigned
- Must be initialized at declaration

## Type Coercion and Conversion

JavaScript performs automatic type conversion:
- Implicit coercion in operations
- Explicit conversion with Number(), String(), Boolean()
- Strict equality (===) vs loose equality (==)`,

      title: 'Functions and Scope',
      content: `# Functions Deep Dive

## Function Declarations
\`\`\`javascript
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name;
}
\`\`\`

## Function Expressions
\`\`\`javascript
const greet = function(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name;
};
\`\`\`

## Arrow Functions (ES6)
\`\`\`javascript
const greet = (name) => "Hello, " + name;
\`\`\`

### Arrow Function Characteristics
- Concise syntax
- Implicit return for single expressions
- Lexical 'this' binding
- Cannot be used as constructors

## Scope and Closures

### Global Scope
Variables accessible everywhere in the code

### Function Scope
Variables accessible within the function

### Block Scope
Variables declared with let/const in blocks

### Lexical Scoping
Inner functions have access to outer function variables

## Closures
A closure is when a function retains access to its lexical scope even after the outer function has executed.

\`\`\`javascript
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function() {
    return ++count;
  };
}

const counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
\`\`\`

### Use Cases for Closures
- Data privacy and encapsulation
- Factory functions
- Event handlers
- Callback functions
- Module pattern`,

    {
      title: 'Arrays and Array Methods',
      content: `# Working with Arrays

## Array Creation
\`\`\`javascript
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = new Array(1, 2, 3);
const arr3 = Array.from('hello'); // ['h','e','l','l','o']
\`\`\`

## Essential Array Methods

### map() - Transform Elements
\`\`\`javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const doubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2);
// [2, 4, 6, 8]
\`\`\`

### filter() - Select Elements
\`\`\`javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const evens = numbers.filter(n => n % 2 === 0);
// [2, 4]
\`\`\`

### reduce() - Aggregate Values
\`\`\`javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, n) => acc + n, 0);
// 10
\`\`\`

### find() - First Match
\`\`\`javascript
const users = [{id: 1, name: 'John'}, {id: 2, name: 'Jane'}];
const user = users.find(u => u.id === 2);
\`\`\`

### forEach() - Iterate
\`\`\`javascript
numbers.forEach(n => console.log(n));
\`\`\`

### some() and every()
\`\`\`javascript
const hasEven = numbers.some(n => n % 2 === 0); // true
const allEven = numbers.every(n => n % 2 === 0); // false
\`\`\`

## Array Destructuring
\`\`\`javascript
const [first, second, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
// first: 1, second: 2, rest: [3, 4, 5]
\`\`\`

## Spread Operator
\`\`\`javascript
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [...arr1, 4, 5]; // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
\`\`\``,
      duration: '28 min read'
    },
    {
      title: 'Objects and Object-Oriented Programming',
      content: `# Objects in JavaScript

## Object Creation

### Object Literal
\`\`\`javascript
const person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  greet() {
    console.log(\`Hello, I'm \${this.name}\`);
  }
};
\`\`\`

### Constructor Function
\`\`\`javascript
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
}

const john = new Person('John', 30);
\`\`\`

### ES6 Classes
\`\`\`javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(\`Hello, I'm \${this.name}\`);
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Object Methods

### Object.keys(), Object.values(), Object.entries()
\`\`\`javascript
const obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};
Object.keys(obj);    // ['a', 'b', 'c']
Object.values(obj);  // [1, 2, 3]
Object.entries(obj); // [['a', 1], ['b', 2], ['c', 3]]
\`\`\`

### Object.assign()
\`\`\`javascript
const target = {a: 1};
const source = {b: 2};
Object.assign(target, source); // {a: 1, b: 2}
\`\`\`

## Prototypes and Inheritance

Every JavaScript object has a prototype from which it inherits properties and methods.

\`\`\`javascript
function Animal(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Animal.prototype.speak = function() {
  console.log(\`\${this.name} makes a sound\`);
};

function Dog(name) {
  Animal.call(this, name);
}

Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;
\`\`\`

## ES6 Class Inheritance
\`\`\`javascript
class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(\`\${this.name} makes a sound\`);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    super(name);
    this.breed = breed;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log(\`\${this.name} barks\`);
  }
}

      title: 'Asynchronous JavaScript',
      content: `# Mastering Async Programming

## Callbacks
The traditional way to handle async operations:

\`\`\`javascript
function fetchData(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    callback('Data received');
  }, 1000);
}

fetchData((data) => {
  console.log(data);
});
\`\`\`

### Callback Hell Problem
Nested callbacks become hard to read and maintain.

## Promises

Promises represent the eventual completion or failure of an async operation.

### Promise States
- **Pending**: Initial state
- **Fulfilled**: Operation completed successfully
- **Rejected**: Operation failed

### Creating Promises
\`\`\`javascript
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve('Success!');
  }, 1000);
});
\`\`\`

### Consuming Promises
\`\`\`javascript
promise
  .then(result => console.log(result))
  .catch(error => console.error(error))
  .finally(() => console.log('Done'));
\`\`\`

### Promise Chaining
\`\`\`javascript
fetchUser()
  .then(user => fetchPosts(user.id))
  .then(posts => console.log(posts))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
\`\`\`

## Async/Await

Modern syntax for working with promises:

\`\`\`javascript
async function getData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}
\`\`\`

### Benefits of Async/Await
- Cleaner, more readable code
- Easier error handling with try/catch
- Better debugging experience
- Looks synchronous but runs asynchronously

## Promise Utilities

### Promise.all()
Wait for all promises to resolve:
\`\`\`javascript
const results = await Promise.all([
  fetch('/api/users'),
  fetch('/api/posts'),
  fetch('/api/comments')
]);
\`\`\`

### Promise.race()
Returns the first promise to settle:
\`\`\`javascript
const fastest = await Promise.race([
  fetchFromServer1(),
  fetchFromServer2()
]);
\`\`\`

### Promise.allSettled()
Wait for all promises to settle (fulfilled or rejected):
\`\`\`javascript
const results = await Promise.allSettled([
  promise1,
  promise2,
  promise3
]);
\`\`\``,
      duration: '35 min read'
    },
    {
      title: 'ES6+ Modern Features',
      content: `# Modern JavaScript Features

## Template Literals
\`\`\`javascript
const name = 'John';
const greeting = \`Hello, \${name}!\`;
const multiLine = \`
  Line 1
  Line 2
  Line 3
\`;
\`\`\`

## Destructuring

### Array Destructuring
\`\`\`javascript
const [a, b, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
\`\`\`

### Object Destructuring
\`\`\`javascript
const {name, age, city = 'Unknown'} = person;
\`\`\`

### Function Parameters
\`\`\`javascript
function greet({name, age}) {
  console.log(\`\${name} is \${age} years old\`);
}
\`\`\`

## Spread and Rest Operators

### Spread Operator
\`\`\`javascript
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [...arr1, 4, 5];

const obj1 = {a: 1, b: 2};
const obj2 = {...obj1, c: 3};
\`\`\`

### Rest Parameters
\`\`\`javascript
function sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
}
\`\`\`

## Default Parameters
\`\`\`javascript
function greet(name = 'Guest', age = 0) {
  console.log(\`Hello \${name}, age \${age}\`);
}
\`\`\`

## Optional Chaining
\`\`\`javascript
const user = {profile: {name: 'John'}};
const name = user?.profile?.name; // 'John'
const age = user?.profile?.age; // undefined
\`\`\`

## Nullish Coalescing
\`\`\`javascript
const value = null ?? 'default'; // 'default'
const value2 = 0 ?? 'default'; // 0
\`\`\`

## Modules

### Export
\`\`\`javascript
export const name = 'John';
export function greet() {}
export default class Person {}
\`\`\`

### Import
\`\`\`javascript
import Person, {name, greet} from './person.js';
